        Once upon a time, there was a speedy Hare who bragged about how fast he could run. 
        Tired of hearing him boast, Slow and Steady, the Tortoise, challenged him to a race. 
        "You must be joking!" said the Hare laughing. "But alright, let's race!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hare ran down the road for a while and then paused to rest. He looked back at Slow and Steady 
        and cried out, "How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at your slow, slow pace?" 
        The Hare stretched himself out alongside the road and fell asleep, thinking, "There is plenty of time to relax."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tortoise walked and walked. He never, ever stopped until he came to the finish line. 
        The animals who were watching cheered so loudly for Tortoise, they woke up Hare. 
        Hare stretched and yawned and began to run again, but it was too late. Tortoise was already over the line.
